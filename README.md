# Inspirational quotes

I am starting my journey as a frontend developer with the hopes of becoming fullstack. I use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My instrucions were to create a landing page of one quote with an nature background. Making sure I styled is as the figma file. Accomodating Stretch goals were added using an array object of multiple quotes. Using JavaScript I was able to get random quotes while change the nature background. 
I have a hard time not overthinking the solutions, but will get better with time and more practice.
